# Portfolio

Well, this is a "little project" to do a Portfolio so… I'm not a good Front-End Developer, but I have my "Aces" so I have a bit of knowledge :)

## Structure
 - Home page
 - Projects page
 - Contact

Pretty much, that's the basic structure of this portfolio.

### Home Page
 - It's the "Fancy" part of the page, It has a brief introduction, some of my programming skills will be shown below, studies ...
 - One button to have a direct contact
 - Maybe to switch between content It will have some cool animation (For the moment it's an idea)

### Projects Page
 Currently, on development
 
### Contact
 Currently, on development
 
 ## Technologies used
  - The basics HTML, CSS, JS
  - Using sass for CSS
  - Probably going to use swiper.js or some frameworks like that …
  - Maybe I'll use some three.js for some 3D animations
These are just suggestions, right now
