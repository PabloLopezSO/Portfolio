# Portfolio

Well, this is a "little project" to do a Portfolio so… I'm not a good Front-End Developer, but I have my "Aces" so I have a bit of knowledge :)

## Structure
  * Home page 
  * Projects page
  * Contact

Pretty much, that's the basic structure of this portfolio.

### Home Page
  * It's the "Fancy" part of the page, It has a brief introduction, some of my programming skills will be shown below, studies ...
  * One button to have a direct contact
  * Sliders to add "coolness"
 

### Projects Page
 * It has some sliders, so the user can slide and adds more "coolness"
 * Each project links to the repository of the project
 
### Contact
 * It has a form to ask for anything
 * The contact button instant saves the subject and text of the form, so the user only has to click on "send"
 
## Technologies used
  * The basics HTML, CSS, JS
  * Using sass for CSS
  * Swiper.js for the sliders
  * Bootstrap for the form
